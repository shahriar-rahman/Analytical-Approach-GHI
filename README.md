# An Analytical Approach to Meteorological Database
The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is a serially complete collection of hourly and half-hourly values of meteorological data and the three most common measurements of solar radiation: global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance.

It covers the United States and a growing subset of international locations. These data have been collected at a sufficient number of locations and temporal and spatial scales to accurately represent regional solar radiation climates. For a given location covered by the dataset, it is possible to see the amount of solar energy that was at a given time and to predict the potential future availability of solar energy based on past conditions.

### â—˜ Introduction
Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) is a widely used type of data available through the NSRDB. TMYs contain one year of hourly data that best represents median weather conditions over a multiyear period.

The data are considered "typical" because the entirety of the original solar radiation and meteorological data is condensed into one year's worth of the most usual conditions. Although a TMY can be thought of as a median, the methods used to calculate it consider many factors beyond a simple calculation of median values, including solar resource data and weather data such as wind speed and ambient temperature.
